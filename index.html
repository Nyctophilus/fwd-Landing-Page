            <p>
              Shyness is a feeling of awkwardness or
              discomfort in the presence of others. Most
              people who are shy learn to adapt to their
              surroundings and function in a world that is
              dominated by more outgoing and extroverted
              types. At the same time, it can be easy to get
              down on yourself if you are shy; it might seem
              like everyone else is doing better socially
              than you. At times like these, it is helpful
              to consider some of the benefits or advantages
              of being shy. These might not be things that
              immediately come to mind, but they are true of
              many shy people. This list of 10 good things
              about being shy might also be helpful if you
              are overcoming SAD and still struggling with
              shy tendencies.

            <strong>Your Modesty Is Attractive</strong>
            <p>
              Many shy people are modest; you are the last
              one to announce your accomplishments or let
              the world know what is amazing about you. You
              probably shrink from compliments or downplay
              your positive attributes. <br /><q
                >Although too much modesty can eat away at
                self-esteem, a healthy dose is considered an
                attractive trait by many.</q

          <h2>How to Say No</h2>

          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              Many of us hesitate to say no to others. With
              mindful tips like these, saying no is an
              emotionally intelligent skill anyone can
              master — really!
            </p>

            <p>
              It’s just two letters, and yet saying no can
              feel really hard — even complicated. For many
              of us, saying no doesn’t just feel awkward. It
              feels wrong. So, whenever anyone asks you to
              do almost anything, you might blurt out, “Yes!
              Sure! Of course! Happy to!” But in reality,
              you may feel the opposite. Maybe you’d rather
              be doing about a thousand other things. Or
              maybe you’re OK with saying yes, but it’s not
              the best thing for your daily bandwidth or
              mental health. Here’s the good news: Saying no
              is a skill you can sharpen. The more you say
              no, the more natural it’ll feel. Here are
              several ways to build the skill of saying no
              in different situations — even if it feels
              like you’re doing it from the ground up.

              Do you fume when someone cuts you off in

              your child refuses to cooperate? Anger is a

              important to deal with it in a positive way.

              Think before you speak In, the heat of the
              moment, it's easy to say something you'll
              later regret. Take a few moments to collect
              your thoughts before saying anything — and
              allow others involved in the situation to do
              the same.
              <br />
              Once you're calm, express your anger As soon
              as you're thinking clearly, express your
              frustration in an assertive but
              nonconfrontational way. State your concerns
              and needs clearly and directly, without
              hurting others or trying to control them.

              DIY blogs are very interesting and have a huge
              audience. It has multiple sub-types like arts
              and crafts, construction, wood-work,
              metal-work and more. She worked on the DIY
              upgrades while staying home during the
              pandemic, and the redo took about two weeks to
              complete. “I had nothing but spare time and
              ideas waiting to be executed,” she says.

              To achieve her vision, she painted the walls a
              fun, retro-looking green (Behr’s Sweet Grass).
              Her backsplash, which looks like pink tile, is
              actually a white peel-and-stick option painted
              light pink (Behr’s Flamingo Feather.) “Paint
              solves everything” is Cyeira’s DIY motto. “If
              you don’t like something, paint it!” she says.
              She applied that same mentality to her floors,
              which she says were an “intense labor of
              love.”

          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              I’ve been looking forward to this episode
              almost as much as I was looking forward to
              seeing the actual movie last year. This is
              it—the big Dune discussion. This is a great
              story for everybody. It takes itself
              seriously, but it takes the audience
              seriously, too. And it was certainly one of
              the best movies of 2021.I can’t recommend this
              one enough, but even if you haven’t seen it
              yet, put on your space helmet, sit tight and
              listen. We’re about to pick this mythic, epic,
              excellent film apart to find the nuggets of
              wisdom most pertinent to the entrepreneurs,
              self-improvers and all-around goal crushers
              among us.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our first takeaway comes from the very first
              scene of the film. It’s a strange sound
              (listen to the podcast to hear it) accompanied
              by words that appear on the screen: “Dreams
              are messages from the deep.” This little quote
              gets almost no direct explanation in the
              movie, but we later hear the fabulously named
              Duncan Idaho (​​Jason Momoa) issue a retort:
              “Dreams make good stories. But everything
              important happens when we’re awake.” I love
              that. The two messages come together perfectly
              to speak to anyone who has a vision for how
              their life, their career or the world should
              be. Your dreams are important messages from
              your true self, and sometimes they inform you
              and push you forward in ways your conscious
              mind alone might never have. But when you’re
              awake, that’s when you make things happen.
              Marry the two, and you’ve got messages from
              the deep informing your conscious processes.
              That’s a goal-achieving formula if I’ve ever
              heard one. It’s not hard to see how this plays
              out in the non-movie world. If you look around
              at anything—a swingset in a backyard, a
              skyscraper, a past achievement, your home—you
              see evidence of someone having gone deep to
              achieve a vision. But there were physical
              materials and physical labors involved in
              getting there.
